title: "Variables"
description: "Variables store data in JavaScript. There are three main ways to declare variables: let, const, and var."
icon: "code"
---

* let: Used for variables whose value may change.

* const: Used for constants whose value cannot be changed.


* var: An older way to declare variables, typically not recommended for modern JavaScript.

> Best Practices:
> â€¢	Use let and const instead of var. Prefer const for values that will not change, as it helps maintain code predictability and maintainability.

```variables.js
let name = "John";  // Variable declaration, can be changed
const age = 25;     // Constant declaration, cannot be changed

// Changing a variable value
name = "Alice";  // name is now "Alice"
// age = 30;  // Error! Cannot change a constant value
```
